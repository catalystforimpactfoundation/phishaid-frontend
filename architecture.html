  <h1>System Architecture</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Serverless and Scalable Design for Rule-Based Phishing Detection</div>

  <p>
    PhishAID is designed using a lightweight, serverless architecture that
    emphasizes scalability, low operational overhead, and high availability.
    The architecture eliminates the need for traditional server management
    while ensuring fast response times and reliable access.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system is deployed using modern edge and cloud-native services, making
    it suitable for academic demonstrations, real-world experimentation, and
    large-scale public access.
  </p>

  <h2>Architectural Overview</h2>
  <p>
    PhishAID follows a client–edge–logic model where phishing detection is
    performed through deterministic rules rather than computationally intensive
    machine learning pipelines.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core architectural components include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>User Interface (HTML/CSS)</b> – A lightweight browser-based interface for URL submission and result display.</li>
    <li><b>Rule Engine (JavaScript)</b> – Implements phishing detection logic using predefined, explainable rules.</li>
    <li><b>Static Hosting</b> – Frontend is deployed using Cloudflare Pages for global availability.</li>
    <li><b>CDN & Security Layer</b> – Cloudflare provides caching, DDoS protection, and secure content delivery.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Serverless and Edge-Based Design</h2>
  <p>
    PhishAID follows a serverless architecture model, where detection logic is
    executed without maintaining dedicated backend servers. Hosting the
    application at the network edge reduces latency and improves performance
    for users across different geographic regions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This design choice also minimizes maintenance effort, simplifies deployment,
    and allows the system to scale automatically based on demand.
  </p>

  <h2>Request Processing Flow</h2>
  <p>
    The step-by-step flow of a phishing detection request is as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>User submits a URL through the web interface.</li>
    <li>The request is routed through the Cloudflare CDN.</li>
    <li>The rule engine evaluates the URL against predefined phishing indicators.</li>
    <li>A verdict along with rule-based warnings is generated.</li>
    <li>The result is returned instantly to the user’s browser.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security and Availability Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Cloudflare’s CDN and security services provide an additional protection
    layer, ensuring resilience against malicious traffic and denial-of-service
    attacks. Static hosting further reduces the attack surface by eliminating
    server-side vulnerabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The architecture ensures:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>High availability with minimal downtime</li>
    <li>Global access with low latency</li>
    <li>Secure and reliable content delivery</li>
    <li>Easy extensibility for future enhancements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Architectural Extensions</h2>
  <p>
    While the current architecture focuses on rule-based detection, it is
    designed to support future extensions such as backend APIs, logging
    services, and optional AI-assisted analysis modules in later project phases.
  </p>

  <p>
    This modular approach ensures that PhishAID can evolve without requiring a
    complete redesign of the system architecture.
