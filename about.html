<h1>About PhishAID</h1>

<p>
PhishAID is an academic cybersecurity project focused on detecting phishing websites
using a transparent, rule-based detection engine.
</p>

<p>
The project is developed as part of an academic curriculum and is aligned with
national-level AI challenge problem statements related to phishing detection.
</p>

<p>
Unlike black-box machine learning systems, PhishAID emphasizes
<strong>explainability, interpretability, and early-stage risk detection</strong>.
