  <h1>About PhishAID</h1>

  <p>
    PhishAID is an academic cybersecurity project focused on detecting phishing
    websites using a transparent and explainable rule-based engine.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project was developed as part of an academic curriculum and emphasizes
    infrastructure awareness, security principles, and research alignment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike black-box machine learning systems, PhishAID prioritizes interpretability,
    making it suitable for education, research, and demonstration purposes.
