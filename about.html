  <h1>About PhishAID</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Academic Rule-Based Phishing Detection Project</p>

  <p>
    PhishAID is an academic cybersecurity project focused on detecting phishing
    websites using a transparent, deterministic, and explainable rule-based
    detection engine. Unlike black-box machine learning systems, PhishAID
    emphasizes clear security logic, rule traceability, and human-understandable
    decision making.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project is designed to support cybersecurity education, research,
    and awareness by demonstrating how phishing detection can be implemented
    using URL analysis, transport-level indicators, identity deception patterns,
    and semantic intent heuristics.
  </p>

  <h2>Phase 1: Rule-Based Detection Framework</h2>
  <p>
    Phase 1 focuses on the design and implementation of a comprehensive
    rule-based phishing detection engine. This phase includes the evaluation
    of multiple phishing indicators such as HTTPS usage, URL structure,
    suspicious domains, certificate age, homoglyph attacks, typosquatting,
    and semantic phishing intent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each rule is independently evaluated and contributes to a cumulative
    risk score, enabling clear classification of websites as Legitimate,
    Suspicious, or Phishing. The system generates detailed rule-wise reports
    and downloadable PDF analysis for transparency and auditability.
  </p>

  <h2>Phase 2: Infrastructure Awareness & Intelligent Extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Phase 2 aims to extend the system with infrastructure-level awareness,
    behavioral indicators, and intelligent enhancements. This includes
    integration with domain intelligence, hosting analysis, DNS patterns,
    historical reputation signals, and optional AI-assisted modules for
    large-scale phishing trend analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    This phase also aligns the project with national-level AI and cybersecurity
    challenge problem statements by focusing on explainability, responsible AI
    design, and real-world deployability in public-facing digital ecosystems.
