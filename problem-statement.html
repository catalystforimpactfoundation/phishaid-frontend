<h1>Project Origin & Problem Statement</h1>

<h2>Source of the Idea</h2>
<p>
PhishAID is inspired by <strong>Problem Statement PS-02</strong> from a national AI
challenge focused on detecting phishing domains and URLs targeting critical sector entities.
</p>

<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
<p>
Phishing attacks exploit user trust by creating deceptive URLs, domains,
and web interfaces that impersonate legitimate organizations.
</p>

<h2>Academic Motivation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Early detection of suspicious URLs</li>
<li>Explainable decision-making</li>
<li>Independence from proprietary threat feeds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
PhishAID translates the problem statement into a lightweight,
rule-based web application suitable for academic evaluation.
