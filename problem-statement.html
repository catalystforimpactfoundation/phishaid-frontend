  <h1>Project Origin & Problem Statement</h1>

  <p>
    PhishAID is inspired by Problem Statement PS-02 from a national-level AI Challenge
    addressing phishing detection targeting critical sector entities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The challenge highlights the need for early detection of malicious domains,
    look-alike URLs, and deceptive web links before large-scale exploitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project translates the challenge requirements into a practical,
    rule-based web application suitable for academic evaluation.
