  <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Understanding the Challenge of Phishing Website Detection</div>

  <p>
    Phishing attacks continue to be one of the most prevalent and dangerous
    cybersecurity threats in today’s digital ecosystem. These attacks exploit
    human trust by impersonating legitimate organizations, leading to financial
    loss, identity theft, credential compromise, and large-scale data breaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the rapid growth of online banking, e-commerce, and digital governance,
    phishing websites have become increasingly sophisticated, often bypassing
    traditional blacklist-based and signature-based security mechanisms.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
  <p>
    This project is inspired by the AI Challenge Problem Statement (PS-2), which
    emphasizes the detection of phishing websites using intelligent and scalable
    techniques. The challenge highlights the need for solutions that are not only
    accurate but also transparent and explainable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most modern detection systems rely heavily on machine learning models that
    act as black boxes. While effective, these systems lack interpretability,
    making them unsuitable for academic evaluation, regulatory environments, and
    trust-critical applications.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Problem Definition</h2>
  <p>
    The core problem addressed by this project is the design of a phishing
    detection system that can accurately identify malicious websites while
    clearly explaining <b>why</b> a website is classified as phishing,
    suspicious, or legitimate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system must analyze multiple characteristics of a website such as URL
    structure, domain properties, transport-level indicators, identity deception
    patterns, and semantic intent, without relying on opaque decision-making
    models.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The primary objectives of this project are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>To detect phishing websites using a transparent, rule-based framework</li>
    <li>To provide explainable, rule-wise evaluation for every analyzed website</li>
    <li>To reduce false positives while maintaining detection reliability</li>
    <li>To align with academic, ethical, and national-level AI challenge standards</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scope and Relevance</h2>
  <p>
    The proposed solution is designed for academic research, educational
    demonstrations, and foundational cybersecurity studies. It serves as a
    baseline system that can later be extended with advanced infrastructure
    analysis or hybrid AI techniques while preserving explainability.
