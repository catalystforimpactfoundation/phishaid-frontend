  <h1>Technical Stack & Infrastructure</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Tools, Platforms, and Services Used in PhishAID</div>

  <p>
    PhishAID is built using a modern, cloud-native technology stack designed
    for simplicity, scalability, and security. Each component of the system
    is selected to support a rule-based phishing detection workflow while
    maintaining transparency and ease of deployment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stack integrates frontend technologies, backend services, cloud
    infrastructure, and security layers into a cohesive and maintainable system.
  </p>

  <h2>Infrastructure Design Rationale</h2>
  <p>
    The infrastructure is designed to minimize operational complexity while
    maintaining strong security guarantees. Static frontend hosting combined
    with serverless backend deployment reduces maintenance overhead and
    eliminates single points of failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cloudflare services provide an additional security and performance layer,
    while Google Cloud Run enables automatic scaling based on request load.
  </p>

  <h2>Scalability and Maintainability</h2>
  <p>
    PhishAID’s modular architecture allows individual components such as the
    rule engine, database, and notification system to be extended or replaced
    independently. This design supports future enhancements without requiring
    major architectural changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The use of containerization and managed cloud services ensures that the
    system remains portable, reliable, and easy to deploy across environments.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Stack Enhancements</h2>
  <p>
    In later phases, the technical stack can be extended to include advanced
    analytics dashboards, hybrid AI-assisted detection modules, and integration
    with threat intelligence feeds while preserving the existing rule-based
    foundation.
