  <h3>Implemented in Version 1.0</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Rules 1–10 — URL & Transport-level analysis</li>
    <li>Rule 18 — Clone phishing (DOM similarity heuristic)</li>
    <li>Rules 21–22 — Identity deception (homoglyph & typosquatting)</li>
    <li>Rule 30 — Semantic phishing intent (heuristic-based)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reserved for Future Work</h3>
  <p>
    Rules <strong>11–17, 19, 20, 23, 25, 27–29</strong> are part of the
    PhishAID design framework but are not implemented in v1.0 due to
    higher engineering, crawling, or dataset requirements.
